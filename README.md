## Aerial Video Segmentation Dataset (AVSD)

Video segmentation refers to the task of partitioning pixels that exhibit homogeneous appearance and motion into coherent spatial-temporal groups. Aerial video segmentation have a wide variety of practical applications, such as landscape detection and recognition, ground scene classification, and urgent safe landing. However, few works about video segmentation for higher-altitude aerial platforms are developed in the current literatures due to the lack of common evaluation dataset. Thus, we assemble a new evaluation dataset, which exhibits the simple and challenging conditions of video complexity and motion, for the video segmentation of aerial applications.

The dataset contains a total of 10 diverse sequences, 525 images, of which 102 images are annotated. The images are all captured at 12 fps and 1280*1024 spatial resolution. The images contain a variety of “objects,” such as man-made and natural scene elements, of which the appearance varies across sequences and comprises homogenous and textured parts. We select 6 sequences to be annotated by experts with pixel-wise labels for about every fourth frame. The primary subjects of the aerial videos are mainly various land surfaces and we define six most common types: bare land, grassland, forest, building, road, and vehicles.
